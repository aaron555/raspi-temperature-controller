# Control setpoint (stored in file 'setpoint') for use with temperature controller

# SYNTAX: ./settemp [<setpoint>]

# EXAMPLE CALLS
# ./settemp 20.5

# INPUTS
# Optionally specify setpoint in degrees (C) as a float or integer to set new setpoint
# If no input argument specified, reads back current setpoint
# Uses configured location for setpoint file and logfile in /etc/controller.conf (this will take precedence) if not present config/controller.conf will be used
# If neither config file exists or contains setpoint location, the directory in which script is located will be used for setpoint file

# OUTPUTS
# Returns current/newly set setpoint to STDOUT and configured controller logfile with timestamps

# Changelog
# 2014 - First Version
# 06/2020 - Improved error handling and configuration from file, updated config keys
